#app-redux-react
This is a sample in progress application for learning React with Redux using Immutable structures and redux-thunk middleware for asynchronous call.

##How it works?
Upon pressing on button application loads list of "funny" posts from Reddit and displays a random one.
It does not cache the posts, so each time it reloads all posts. This will be improved later.
